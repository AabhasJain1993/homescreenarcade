Touch the score area to pause the game.\n\n[TABLE_RULES]\n\nSelecting the Preferences button or menu item allows you to change the following settings:\n- Sound: Enables and disables sound effects\n- Background Music: Enables and disabled background music\n- Independent Flippers: When unchecked, any touch activates both flippers. When checked, you must touch the left side of the screen for the left flipper, and the right side for the right flipper.\n- Zoom: When checked, the view will be zoomed on the ball\'s location during game play.\n- OpenGL Rendering: Uses OpenGL to draw graphics.
